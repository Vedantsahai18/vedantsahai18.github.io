								 Built an end-to-end architectural system that incorporates human pose estimator, emotion recognition and head gaze deep learning model into a customized neural network Intelligent Classrooms employees a suite of 3 computer vision models that enables a holistic understanding of a student Emotion Recognition Human Pose Estimation Gaze Detection .
								 These outputs are harnessed as inputs into a customized neural network that generates a prediction of engagement levels of the student. The engagement level is then displayed in a classroom heatmap to show the dynamic changes in classroom engagement.
								 Engagement levels are also plotted onto a dynamic chart to monitor the lesson across the lessons and help teachers to find the optimal time to call for breaks. </p>

							<h2>Leveraging Conversational AI for Secure Healthcare Assistance </h2>
							<a href="https://github.com/ejson03/Medical-Analytica" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size:36px"></i></a>
							<p class="mt-4">There is a rapid increase in the generation of medical data especially in a situation of medical emergency or crisis.
								When hospitals are understaffed to maintain healthcare data, they are prone to be tampered with. Users do not receive their medical information on time and cannot approach other institutions quickly with their medical history. 
								Solution: Bring EHR to blockchain BigchainDB is a decentralized database that has immutability just like traditional blockchains. We have attempted to develop an end to end system for successful storage, transfer and tracking of patient healthcare data. 
								All records are encrypted using AES-256 encryption and the access for this data is transferred through blockchain and asymmetric cryptography. Due to limited blockchain data storage, files are being stored in IPFS. A basic chatbot is also designed to avoid entering data manually into forms. 
								Conversational history is tracked and stored on the blockchain too to maintain the credibility of the chatbot performance.</p>

								<p class="mt-4">This project was undertaken as a part of SYMBIOSIS AI HACKATHON 2019 where I and my team had to convert a voice-based conversation between a customer and service centre and find out the context of the conversation and classify it accordingly.
									Currently, call centre agents to interact with customers and try to facilitate and fulfil customer needs. 
									As part of the solution, you need to classify the customer conversations into different categories of calls linked with automotive industry (i.e., new vehicle purchase, inquiries, test drive request, break down assistance, roadside assistance etc.) for necessary action by the business. </p>

								<h2>Integration of Airside Safety Management Application (ASMA) in Incident Monitoring System (IMS)</h2>
								<p class="mt-4">ASMA is an AngularJS based framework system while IMS is a .net based entity framework. Both the systems had their own set of definitions in terms of functionality, usage, and reachability. Nothing was common in both the systems apart from the database which was used i.e. Microsoft SQL. Our end goal was to make ASMA the front end and IMS function as the sole and only system for the management of the tickets booked instead of two different systems running at two different levels. The functionalities of ASMA and IMS had to be mapped in the database of IMS, which was the most difficult part of the integration as both the system had different Escalation time, Priorities and Data Entry Parameters. APIs had to be created in IMS so that ASMA could consume this IMS API to send and receive data from the front end which had an Angular framework to the IMS backend which is Entity .net framework. </p>

								<p class="mt-4"> Through this project, I learned to implement DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network and trained the network to generate realistic-looking synthesized images. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos, or audio. Through this hands-on project, I went through the details of how such a network is structured, trained, and will ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST datasets. It needed me to have a theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent. Focusing on the practical aspect of implementing and training DCGAN, but not too much on the theoretical aspect and with prior experience in Python programming. </p>

								The Annex 14 document recommends and explains the process of obstacle control, which is marking and lighting of obstacles, conducting of obstacle surveys, removal or lowering of obstacles and reporting of obstacles to the appropriate authorities. 
								By using our system fully, the aerodrome operator should be able to establish an effective obstacle control process and keep his aerodrome and its vicinity safe for aircraft operations.</p>

							<h2>Establishing a communication link between the ATS and the Flight Feed</h2>
							<p class="mt-5">The existing communication link between ATS Systems and the Flight Feed is based on the Windows platform. A windows .exe file is executed on a scheduled basis (every 90 seconds) with the help of Windows Task Scheduler which runs a utility to send a SOAP request to Flight Feed server and in response gets the AODB ( Airport Database) data in XML format which is then stored in a .txt file. Since Air Traffic Services systems have been migrated to Linux (Ubuntu) environment, a corresponding utility must be developed which will be compatible with the Ubuntu operating system. The communication link between ATS Linux System and the Flight Feed server was established through a Python script which was responsible for sending a SOAP request to the Flight Feed server and in response get the XML data and store in a .txt file. The complete process was scheduled with Crontab and Shell Scripts as it is open-source, robust and flexible in nature.</p>

							<h2>Integration of Payment Module with the KIOSK</h2>
							<p class="mt-4">In the integration of the Payment Module project, I had to integrate a POS i.e. Point of Sale machine ( PAX A920) with the  KIOSK which is computer terminal featuring specialized hardware and software that provides access to information and applications for communication, commerce, entertainment, or education.  The KIOSK had an installed application known as Prepaid Taxi for the customer to book a prepaid inside or outside the airport premises. The exiting setup calculated the total fare of the taxi and this total fare had to be fed manually by a person in the POS machine for the further payment process by a credit/debit card. My job as an intern for to ensure that this manual process of entering the amount becomes an automated process in senses that the application in the KIOSK generated the total fare and directly fed this total fare in the POS machine so that there is no involvement of the third person or the customer to enter it manually enter the fare into the machine . Also, the machine at the end of transactions gives intimidation to the KIOSK system to generate a bill for the customer.  </p>

							<p class="mt-4">In this project, I learned how to analyze datasets for sentiment analysis, how to read it in a PyTorch BERT model and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification. Learning how to adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance. In fine-tuning this model, I learned how to design & train and evaluate a loop to monitor model performance as it trains, including saving and loading models. Finally, I built a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERT's large-scale language knowledge.  </p>

							<h2>COVID19 Face Mask Detection for College</h2>
							<a href="https://github.com/Vedantsahai18/College-Covid-System" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github" style="font-size:36px"></i></a>
							<p class="mt-4">Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams . The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it’s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc).
								This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.  </p>
